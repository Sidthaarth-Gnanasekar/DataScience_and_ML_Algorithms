# ML Algorithms Portfolio

A repository containing a portfolio of machine learning projects that I completed for academic purposes, self-study, and to have a better knowledge of the algorithm concepts. The data is presented using iPython Notebooks.

# Machine Learning Algorithm Projects

* ## Linear & Multivariate linear regression:
   * Using a simple income dataset in csv format from Kaggle and created a linear regression model to predict income over time. 
   * A multi linear regression model was created to estimate the wage of employees in a hiring dataset with several variables as the dependent variable.


 * ## Logistic Regression: 
     * Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
     
     
* ## Decision Tree:
   * Using a Decision Trees algorithm, we were able to predict whether an individual survived or died on the Titanic ship Using data from the kaggle website.

* ## Gradient descent:
* Gradient descent is an iterative optimization method for determining which model parameters have the lowest cost or error values. In this project, I coded a gradient descent method without utilising any python libraries such as sklearn in order to gain a better understanding of the algorithm and how it works on the backend, and I tried my hardest to grasp concepts such as backpropagation and the chain rule.


* ## Grid Search:
  * In a dataset, grid search is used to locate the best model, as well as its parameters and hyper parameters, so that we can employ the model that performs better for the datasets.

* ## KMeans Clustering:

  * Installed an iris dataset from sklearn and used the kmeans clustering algorithm to determine how many clusters the dataset has, which can be determined using the elbow approach.
