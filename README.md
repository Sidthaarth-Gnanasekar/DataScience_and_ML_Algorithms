# ML Algorithms Portfolio

A repository containing a portfolio of machine learning projects that I completed for academic purposes, self-study, and to have a better knowledge of the algorithm concepts. The data is presented using iPython Notebooks.

# Machine Learning Algorithm Projects

* ## Linear & Multivariate linear regression:
   * Using a simple income dataset in csv format from Kaggle and created a linear regression model to predict income over time. 
   * A multi linear regression model was created to estimate the wage of employees in a hiring dataset with several variables as the dependent variable.


 * ## Logistic Regression: 
     * Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
     
     
* ## Decision Tree:
   * Using a Decision Trees algorithm, we were able to predict whether an individual survived or died on the Titanic ship Using data from the kaggle website.


 
 ML with Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
ML with K Nearest Neighbours: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
